Edgeworth is a second generation iris core which extends several aspects of the
iris core. 

- Data and code segments are now 24-bits in length which are expressed as
  32-bit numbers. The upper 8-bits are used as tag bits for the architecture to
  implement Burroughs Large Machine security functionality. 
- Instructions are now 64-bits in length. The control bits have been extended
  from 8-bits to 16-bits. This makes it possible to implement more expressive
  and powerful CISC/RISC/VLIW instructions. The remaining 48 bits can be split
  up however desired (two 24-bit values, 6 registers, or any combination in
  between)
- This core is being implemented in Go instead of C because I finally am
  starting to understand Go and think it is a pretty elegant language. I
  started to "get" Go yesterday (6/18/2014). 
- Graphics operations will be provided by the core as well which requires an
  easy to use cross platform library (Go comes with 'image' which is very
  similar to libdraw from Plan9).

The other objective of this core is to teach me Go as well as take advantage of
features in Go that would be tedious to take advantage of in C.
